        <h3>Snack Share is a Website for the Everyday College Student</h3>
        <p>Snack Share was an idea from the headspace of Freshman Informatics student, Nathan Medsker. Currently, Snack Share is a work in progress. Having limited knowledge of programming in anything, Nathan has tried his best to create a fairly interactive web experience for the user. To learn about Nathan, his successes and fails with Snack Share, and his time at IUPUI, click on "About the Designer" above. The "Example Posts" link will take you to a webpage where posts for Snack Share would be displayed. This page has examples for what posts would look like in a functioning social media site. The user will be able to learn about Snack Share's original design and more by going to the "Original Idea" Page on the navigation bar above. </p>
        <p>I appreciate the time that you have spent coming here to learn about my work in progress. Thank you!</p>
