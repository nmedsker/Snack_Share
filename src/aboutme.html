        <h3>Other Information</h3>
        <p>This paragraph gives you a little information as to why I decided on making my project Snack Share. My first reason for creating Snack Share is that I am in college, and I need to learn more cheap recipes that will keep me decently healthy. The apps that are out there did not accomplish what I wanted. The main app that people use for recipes and sharing recipes now is Pinterest, and it is awful. I hate Pinterest with a passion and wanted to create something that could appeal to college students. There is a constant layout for the site, and it only has a single purpose: share easy and/or cheap recipes with other college students.</p>
