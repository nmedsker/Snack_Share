        <h3>Explanation of This Page</h3>
        <p>I would like to explain what differentiates this page from the examples page. This page can be thought of as the "I tried my hardest but could not make it work successfully" page. This is where I tried my best to create an editable flip card type of post. These were going to be hybrids of the examples that Profesor Lysts had provided in class, but I could not get them to work properly. I believe this to be my own fault as I had set lofty goals for this project, and I had little experience in Javascript. Most of my practice with JS came from editing and messing around with the previously mentioned files that Professor Lyst had provided the class with.</p>
        <p>The examples posts page is the dream. I would like them to ne interactive for each user, but currently they are not. I really enjoy the flip card idea still as the picture for the food is provided. If the user likes what they see, all they have to do is flip the card over to see how to make it themselves.</p>
